Welcome to Merlion's documentation!
===================================
Merlion is a Python library for time series intelligence. It features a unified interface for many commonly used
:doc:`models <merlion.models>` and :doc:`datasets <ts_datasets>` for forecasting, anomaly detection, and change
point detection on both univariate and multivariate time series, along with standard
:doc:`pre-processing <merlion.transform>` and :doc:`post-processing <merlion.post_process>` layers.
It has several modules to improve ease-of-use,
including :doc:`visualization <merlion.plot>`,
anomaly score :ref:`calibration <merlion.post_process.calibrate>` to improve interpetability,
:doc:`AutoML <merlion.models.automl>` for hyperparameter tuning and model selection,
and :doc:`model ensembling <merlion.models.ensemble>`.
Merlion also provides a unique :doc:`evaluation framework <merlion.evaluate>`
that simulates the live deployment and re-training of a model in production.
This library aims to provide engineers and researchers a one-stop solution to rapidly develop models
for their specific time series needs, and benchmark them across multiple time series datasets.

Installation
------------
Merlion consists of two sub-packages: :doc:`merlion <merlion>` implements the library's core time series intelligence features,
and :doc:`ts_datasets <ts_datasets>` provides standardized data loaders for multiple time series datasets. These loaders load
time series as ``pandas.DataFrame``Â s with accompanying metadata.

You can install ``merlion`` from PyPI by calling ``pip install salesforce-merlion``. You may install from source by
cloning the Merlion `repo <https://github.com/salesforce/Merlion>`__ and calling ``pip install Merlion/``, or
``pip install -e Merlion/`` to install in editable mode. You may install additional optional dependencies via
``pip install salesforce-merlion[all]``,  or by calling ``pip install "Merlion/[all]"`` if installing from source.
Individually, the optional dependencies include ``dashboard`` for a GUI dashboard,
``spark`` for a distributed computation backend with PySpark, and ``deep-learning`` for all deep learning models.

To install the data loading package ``ts_datasets``, clone the Merlion
`repo <https://github.com/salesforce/Merlion>`__ and call ``pip install -e Merlion/ts_datasets/``. This package must be
installed in editable mode (i.e. with the ``-e`` flag) if you don't want to manually specify the root directory of
every dataset when initializing its data loader.

Note the following external dependencies:

1. Some of our forecasting models depend on OpenMP. Some of our forecasting models depend on OpenMP.
   If using ``conda``, please ``conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm``
   before installing our package. This will ensure that OpenMP is configured to work with the ``lightgbm`` package
   (one of our dependencies) in your ``conda`` environment.
   If using Mac, please install `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__ and call ``brew install libomp`` so that the
   OpenMP libary is available for the model.
   This is relevant for the
   :py:class:`LGBMForecaster <merlion.models.forecast.trees.LGBMForecaster>`,
   which is also used as a part of the :py:class:`DefaultForecaster <merlion.models.defaults.DefaultForecaster>`.

2. Some of our anomaly detection models depend on having the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. For Ubuntu, call
   ``sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk``. For Mac OS, install `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__ and call
   ``brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk && brew install --cask adoptopenjdk11``. Also ensure that ``java`` can be found
   on your ``PATH``, and that the ``JAVA_HOME`` environment variable is set.
   This is relevant for the :py:class:`RandomCutForest <merlion.models.anomaly.random_cut_forest.RandomCutForest>`
   which is also used as a part of the :py:class:`DefaultDetector <merlion.models.defaults.DefaultDetector>`.

Getting Started
---------------
The easiest way to get started is to use the GUI web-based `dashboard <merlion.dashboard>`.
This dashboard provides a great way to quickly experiment with many models on your own custom datasets.
To use it, install Merlion with the optional ``dashboard`` dependency (i.e.
``pip install salesforce-merlion[dashboard]``), and call ``python -m merlion.dashboard`` from the command line.
You can view the dashboard at http://localhost:8050.

For code resources, we recommend the linked tutorials on `anomaly detection <tutorials/anomaly/0_AnomalyIntro>`
and `forecasting <tutorials/forecast/0_ForecastIntro>`. After that, you should read in more detail about Merlion's
main data structure for representing time series `here <tutorials/TimeSeries>`.

Finally, developers should look at the `architecture <architecture>` document to better understand how Merlion's
key components interact with each other.
