    Wrapper to load the dataset used for the final round of the IOPs competition
    (http://iops.ai/competition_detail/?competition_id=5).

    The dataset contains 29 time series of KPIs gathered from large tech
    companies (Alibaba, Sogou, Tencent, Baidu, and eBay). These time series are
    sampled at either 1min or 5min intervals, and are split into train and test
    sections.

    Note that the original competition prohibited algorithms which directly
    hard-coded the KPI ID to set model parameters. So training a new model for
    each time series was against competition rules. They did, however, allow
    algorithms which analyzed each time series (in an automated way), and used
    the results of that automated analysis to perform algorithm/model selection.
