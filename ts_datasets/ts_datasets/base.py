_intro_docstr = "Base dataset class for storing time series as ``pd.DataFrame``Â s."

_main_fns_docstr = """
Each dataset supports the following features:

1.  ``__getitem__``: you may call ``ts, metadata = dataset[i]``. ``ts`` is a time-indexed ``pandas`` DataFrame, with
    each column representing a different variable (in the case of multivariate time series). ``metadata`` is a dict or
    ``pd.DataFrame`` with the same index as ``ts``, with different keys indicating different dataset-specific
    metadata (train/test split, anomaly labels, etc.) for each timestamp.
2.  ``__len__``:  Calling ``len(dataset)`` will return the number of time series in the dataset.
3.  ``__iter__``: You may iterate over the ``pandas`` representations of the time series in the dataset with
    ``for ts, metadata in dataset: ...``

.. note::

    For each time series, the ``metadata`` will always have the key ``trainval``, which is a 
    ``pd.Series`` of ``bool`` indicating whether each timestamp of the time series should be
    training/validation (if ``True``) or testing (if ``False``).
