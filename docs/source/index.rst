Welcome to Merlion's documentation!
===================================
Merlion is a Python library for time series intelligence. It provides an end-to-end machine
learning framework that includes loading and transforming data, building and training models,
post-processing model outputs, and evaluating model performance. It supports various time series
learning tasks, including forecasting and anomaly detection for both univariate and multivariate
time series. It also contains ensemble learning and autoML modules.

Merlion consists of two sub-packages: :py:mod:`merlion` implements the library's core time series intelligence features,
and :py:mod:`ts_datasets` provides standardized data loaders for multiple time series datasets that loads time series as
``pandas.DataFrame``Â s with accompanying metadata.

You can install :py:mod:`merlion` from PyPI by calling ``pip install sfdc-merlion``. You may install from source by
cloning the Merlion `repo <https://github.com/salesforce/Merlion>`_, navigating to the root directory, and calling
``pip install .``, or ``pip install -e .`` to install in editable mode. You may install additional dependencies
for plotting & visualization via ``pip install sfdc-merlion[plot]``, or by calling ``pip install .[plot]`` from the
root directory of the repo if installing from source.

To install the data loading package :py:mod:`ts_datasets`, simply clone the Merlion
`repo <https://github.com/salesforce/Merlion>`_ and call ``pip install -e ts_datasets/``
from its root directory. Note that this package must be installed in editable mode if you don't want to
manually specify the root directory of every dataset when initializing its data loader.

Note the following external dependencies:

1. For Mac users who want to use the :py:class:`Light GBM Forecaster <merlion.models.forecast.boostingtrees.LGBMForecaster>`,
   please install `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ and call ``brew install libomp`` so that the OpenMP libary is
   available for the model.

2. :py:mod:`merlion`'s implementation of :py:mod:`Random Cut Forest <merlion.models.anomaly.random_cut_forest>`
   (a popular anomaly detection model from AWS, proposed by
   `Guha et al. 2016 <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/guha16.pdf>`_) depends on having the Java Development Kit (JDK)
   installed. For Ubuntu, call ``sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk``. For Mac OS, install
   `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ and call ``brew tap adoptopenjdk/openjdk && brew install --cask adoptopenjdk11``.

To get started, we recommend the linked tutorials on `anomaly detection <examples/anomaly/0_AnomalyIntro>`
and `forecasting <examples/forecast/0_ForecastIntro>`.
